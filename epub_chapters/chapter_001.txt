Acknowledgments
Thanks to the four people who helped make it happen:
Stacy Creamer—my editor. If you don’t enjoy the book, blame her… she edited out all the really funny stuff.
Charles Salzberg—writer and teacher. He pushed me hard to keep this project going, so if you don’t enjoy it, blame him, too.
Deborah Schneider—agent extraordinaire. She keeps assuring me she loves at least fifteen percent of everything I do, say, or, especially, write.
Richard David Story—my former boss. Easy to love him now that I no longer have to see him before nineA.M . each day.
And of course a huge thanks to all those who offered no assistance whatsoever but who promised to buy multiple copies for a name mention:
