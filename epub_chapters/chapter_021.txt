Dedicated to the only three people alive who genuinely believe it rivals War and Peace:
My mother, Cheryl, the mom “a million girls would die for”;
My father, Steve, who is handsome, witty, brilliant, and talented, and who insisted on writing his own dedication;
My phenomenal sister, Dana, their favorite (until I wrote a book).
